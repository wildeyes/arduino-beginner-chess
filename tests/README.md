# Beginner Chess Tests

Using:
 - Sublime Text
 - Sublime Text Project Build System
 - Catch C++ Unit Testing Framework

We test our C++ code (only what is non-arduino, of course) that will later be compiled for Arduino.

## Misc
 - Build system must be invoked from a file within tests, otherwise it can't find main.cpp.
