# Beginner Chess

The Arduino project for the Beginner Chess Project.

The beginner chess board is a board that shows you the legal moves when you pick up a piece with lights underneath the grid. It *catches* you when you try to cheat with a red light, and even supports special moves like castling and promoting.

Using just an Arduino Mega2560 to control a hand made, 8 * 8 Matrix of Green/Red (3 lines) Leds, along with a Mux Controller (Designed specifically for this project), we created a chess board that interactes with novice players while they play, providing a rich experience a PC game simply can't offer.

Used:
 - Arduino Mega 2560
 - Hand Made Mux Controller
 - Hand Made LED Matrix
 - Hand Made Chess Board
 - C++
 - Catch Unit Testing Framework
 - Sublime Text
 - Free Time :)
